# Gameplay Mechanics

## Core loop

The server is authoritative and runs at `TICK_RATE` (default 10 ticks/sec).

Per tick:

1. Advance game tick.
2. Process respawns.
3. Process each lane combat.
4. Regenerate strongholds when not under attack.
5. Check victory.

## Round system (Fight Club)

The server cycles through a fixed set of themed rounds:

1. Ogres vs Mages
2. Peasants vs Grunts
3. Death Knights vs Ballistas

Each round defines:

- spawn cadence (`spawnEvery`, `burst`, `maxPerSide`)
- unit types per side
- lane focus (current setup is mid-lane focused)
- hero scaling modifiers (`hpScale`, `damageScale`, `manaScale`)
- duration in ticks

At round end, winner is resolved by:

1. Stronghold HP
2. Alive tower count
3. Combined army power (unit count + hero HP)
4. Draw if equal

## Lane and frontline

- **Single lane (Mid)** — Fight Club mode focuses all combat on the mid lane. Top and bottom lanes are inactive.
- Positions are lane-space from `-100` to `+100`.
- Alliance starts near `-95`, Horde near `+95`.
- Frontline is recomputed from active units and power advantage.

## Creep combat

- Units move every tick based on `speed`.
- Engagement starts when enemies are close enough.
- Units trade attacks using attack cooldowns.
- Dead units are removed from lane arrays.

## Structures

### Towers

- HP: 400
- Damage: 50
- Cooldown: 2 ticks
- Two per side per lane (Outer, Inner)

Towers become vulnerable through lane pressure and are damaged by heroes and unit waves.

### Strongholds

- HP: 1000
- Regen: 5 HP/tick
- Regen delay: 10 ticks after last damage

When a stronghold reaches 0 HP, match winner is set.

## Hero combat model

Heroes auto-act in lane:

- regenerate mana each tick
- cast class ability when affordable and off cooldown
- otherwise basic attack
- respawn 5 ticks after death

## Economy (in-sim)

Gold rewards in combat engine:

- `floor(damage * 0.5)` per damage contribution
- +50 on hero kill
- +100 on tower destruction
- +200 victory bonus

This gold drives local progression and is the base signal for $WOA reward conversion in token mechanics.
